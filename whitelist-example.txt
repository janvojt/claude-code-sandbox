# Claude Code Sandbox Whitelist
# Add absolute or relative paths (one per line) that Claude should be able to read
# - Absolute paths: start with / (e.g., /usr/bin)
# - Relative paths: resolved relative to working directory (e.g., data/, src/**)
# Lines starting with # are ignored
# You can use environment variables like $HOME or ~
# Supports glob patterns: *, ?, []
# Supports ant-style recursive patterns: ** (e.g., /usr/**/lib64 or src/**/config)
# Append :rw for read-write access (e.g., /tmp/cache:rw or data/:rw)

# Example: Relative paths (resolved relative to working directory)
# data/                    # Allow read access to data/ directory
# config/                  # Allow read access to config/ directory
# src/**/*.json            # Allow all .json files under src/
# docs/**                  # Allow all files under docs/ recursively
# build/:rw                # Allow read-write access to build/ directory
